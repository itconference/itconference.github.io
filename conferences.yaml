    description: DevTernity is one of the most demanded developer conferences in Europe. We've been attending every year since 2015 and strongly believe it's the best conference available on the market. DevTernity focuses on the core areas that are paramount to your success — software architecture, clean code, and leadership. We took 1 star off because DevTernity is a victim of its popularity — the rooms are overflowing with people. At DevTernity you learn more than at other conferences (CRAFT and GOTO Berlin are perhaps the only rivals). DevTernity has the best cost/value ratio among competitors.

    description: GeekOut is a two-day show for Java professionals. The conference is well-organized, the venue is great (it's some sort of a factory), and pretty stellar speakers lineup. GeekOut gathers ~600 participants every year and most of the feedback is extremely positive. The conference has a much better cost/value ratio than other Java conferences in Northern Europe. We'd rank GeekOut even higher if the conference offered hands-on workshops.

    description: Devoxx (formerly named JavaPolis) is an annual community conference, created in 2001 by Stephan Janssen, organized by the Belgian Java User Group (BeJUG). The conference takes place every year in Belgium around November. With over 2,800 attendees in 2006, JavaPolis became the biggest vendor-independent Java conference in the world. Personally, we like Devoxx because it sets high standards for itself and other Java conferences. Because the expo is full of sponsors, you will take away a lot of cool swag.

The conference also allows you to meet new people easily, because there is plenty of breaks and room available between sessions to have a chat with others and hang out at one of the expo booths.

At RDD you will enjoy quality content in a comfortable atmosphere in a cinema theater. It's the best place for learning new technologies, sharing experience, and meeting IT colleagues. Riga is easy to reach and is a relatively cheap location. RDD offers compelling prices. Unfortunately, attendees say that many talks are "filler talks" of low-to-medium quality.
