    description: DevTernity is the top tech conference in Latvia. Organisers say that they turn developers into architects and engineering leaders since 2015. We spoke to attendees and attended the conference in 2017 and have to say that the conference is truly excellent. DevTernity focuses on the core areas that are paramount to your success — software architecture, clean code, and leadership. We took 1 star off because DevTernity is victim of its popularty — the rooms are overflowing with people. At DevTernity you learn more than at other conferences (CRAFT and GOTO Berlin are perhaps the only rivals). DevTernity has the best cost/value ratio among competitors.

    description: GeekOut is a two-day show for Java professionals. The conference is well-organized, has amazing venue and pretty stellar speakers lineup. GeekOut gathers ~600 participants every year and most of the feedback is extremely positive. The conference has much better cost/value ratio than other Java conferences in Northern Europe. We'd rank GeekOut even higher if the conference offered hands-on workshops.

    description: Devoxx (formerly named JavaPolis) is an annual community conference, created in 2001 by Stephan Janssen, organized by the Belgian Java User Group (BeJUG). The conference takes place every year in Belgium around November. With over 2,800 attendees in 2006, JavaPolis became the biggest vendor-independent Java conference in the world. Personally, we like Devoxx because it sets high standards for self and other Java conferences.
